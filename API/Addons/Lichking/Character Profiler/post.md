# Character Profiler

CharacterProfiler is a World of Warcraft addon that grabs character info including stats, equipment, inventory (bags & bank), trade skills. This is saved in your SavedVariables\CharacterProfiler.lua in the myProfile block. This information can then be uploaded to your website to display your character info.
