# Dhaskâ€™s FlightMap

FlightMap is all about the flights you take in the World of Warcraft. It draws lines on the continent maps, showing you visually where you can fly from each zone as you mouse over them, as well as showing a window listing all the available destinations, their costs and their flight durations. On the zone level map, flight masters appear as small boot icons, allowing you to see where they are. During flights, a castbar-alike progress bar will show you how long is left on your current journey.Use/fmapor/flightmapto bring up the options window
