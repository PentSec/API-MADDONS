# TrainerSkills

TrainerSkills is a mod that saves the skillframe from trainers so you can bring it up from anywhere in the world. It even turn skills green when you can learn them. It starts out empty so you have to visit your trainers before you see annything in this mod. It also saves your filtersettings at the trainers so you only have to set it once.
