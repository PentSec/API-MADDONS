# QBar

Ever been questing and had to find all those usable quest items in your bags all the time, then this addon is for you. No longer will you have to keep your bags open to do daily bombing quests!This addon will automatically create a dynamic buttonbar for all those usable quest items, it also checks if your equipped gear for usable quest items. As using items is a secure function, QBar is not able to update the bar or the set keybinding when in combat. This will only be changed outside of combat.You may ask, why use this over the buildin quest item buttons? Well, the buildin buttons will only show items you receive when you accept the quest, any usable quest items you loot during a quest will not be shown, QBar will however. QBar will also show items which starts a quest, so you wont miss them in between all the cluttered loot. The default buttons also goes away once you complete the quest, but the item is not actually removed until you turn the quest in, and you may want to use the item even after the quest is complete.If you do not wish to show a certain item on QBar, you can ignore it by holding down Shift and clicking on it.
