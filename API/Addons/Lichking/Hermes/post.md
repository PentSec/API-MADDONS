# Hermes

Hermes tracks your raid’s cooldowns, and displays them using configurable buttons or bars. What’s unique about Hermes is it’s ability to tell you who “does” and “does not” have a particular cooldown available. If you’re a raid leader, healer, tank or anyone who has to coordinate cooldowns, you’ll appreciate the approach Hermes takes.Hermes also tracks cooldowns of non Hermes users using it’s Spell Monitor feature.
