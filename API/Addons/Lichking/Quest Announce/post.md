# Quest Announce

This add-on is designed to keep most anyone informed on the progression of your quests. QuestAnnounce can be configured to announce to Say, Party, Guild, Officer, or /whisper someone directly via the default chat frame. QuestAnnounce can also announce to the UIErrorsFrame and/or the RaidWarning frame for solo announcements.
