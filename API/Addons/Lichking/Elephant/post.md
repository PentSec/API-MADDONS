# Elephant

Elephant logs the chat for you in the background. It saves the WHISPER & BATTLE.NET, RAID, INSTANCE & BATTLEGROUND, PARTY, GUILD, SAY, YELL and OFFICER chats separately, but also all general chats (General, Trade, LocalDefense, …), custom chats you are currently on, achievements, loots and finally system messages (auctions, rolls, server going down, …). You can easily go through all these logs, thanks to a straightforward interface displaying all the access buttons on the right side of the main window. You can access the options of the addon by typing /elephant and also bind a key to pop up the addon.Elephant gives you the ability to copy up to 100,000 (yes, 100k) characers of logs to another application. A BBCode feature is even included, letting you copy/paste a chat with colors and links to an item database in a very quick and simple way to your favorite forum.This is THE addon that you should install if you want to never forget what somebody told you in game. Be a pro of managing hell tells, go peacefully AFK for a few minutes, or be an awesome role player. Elephant is also perfectly designed for Guild Leaders, Officers and Raid Leaders particularly because it saves the chats even when you get disconnected.
