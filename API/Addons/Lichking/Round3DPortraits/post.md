# Round3DPortraits

Creates player and target portraits from 3D models using some modified default UI frame graphics that blend well with the default Blizzard UI elements. You can use it standalone, with completely round frames, or you can use it to cover the default 2D portraits on the default frames by moving the frames around with the mouse.
