# DotTracker

Reminds you when you need to recast dots & debuffs. DotTracker is designed to stay out of your way when you log into a character of a class it doesnâ€™t track. Thus removing the annoyance of turning an addon on & off every time you switch characters. DotTracker stores settings by spec for each toon, so you can design setups for each spec for each character.
