# GnomeSequencerAdvanced

GSE is an advanced macro compiler for WoW. Unlike WoW’s macros, it doesn’t get hung up on the success or failure of the current actions. It just sends the commands to WoW and moves on to the next line. This allows for creative approaches to overcome some of the limitations of WoW’s macro system. GSE cant break the rules, but it can make them more manageable. Every command available to WoW macros is available to GSE.
