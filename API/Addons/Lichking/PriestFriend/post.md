# PriestFriend

PriestFriend helps priests manage their buffs, notifies them when their shackle breaks, reminds you to keep your inner fire up, helps manage their 3 min fear ward, and notifies you when someone gets a disease or magic debuff so you can dispell it. It will also remind you who is dead when combat ends. In addition it plays some funny sayings when you cast spells (but only if you want).
