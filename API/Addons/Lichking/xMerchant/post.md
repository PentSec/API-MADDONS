# xMerchant

xMerchant improves the Vendor-Interface into an easy and clearly arranged scrollable list.Also, it adds a search function.Example: You search items with spell power, then write “spell power” and the list show the relevant items.Items which you can’t use, will be marked in red and the cause why you can’t use this, is displayed.Recipes, that you have not yet learned, are marked green. Recipes, which you already learned are not marked anymore. (based on multiple wish)
