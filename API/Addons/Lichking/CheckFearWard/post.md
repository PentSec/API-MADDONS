# CheckFearWard

Check Fear Ward has the ability to track who has a Fear Ward buff and how long is left on said buff. It also has the ability to alert you when the buff has been consumed or has expired, and on top of a personal alert it also is able to alert your group by adding a message to say, party or raid.
