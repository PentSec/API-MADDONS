# Simple Addon for Icecrown Global Channels (Filter)

**Good day, lads.**

I created a simple addon just for myself to make Icecrown's `/global` chat more readable. It turned out quite good and helpful for me, so I decided to share it with the community. 

If you are tired of:
- Being recruited to Persian guilds,
- Getting frustrated from endless `/y Il No'throma N O O O O L N Zaga maza'rotha Nogah mog NO o A` spam,
- Seeing endless spam about Frostweave Cloth stacks or Paladins with Trade systems,

You might find this tool useful!

## What Does This Addon Do?

This addon allows you to completely skip messages containing words from a **blacklist**.  
You can edit this list directly in the game. Filters are applied to:
- `/y` (yell)
- `/s` (say)
- Global channels

---

### Example

For instance, I've completely banned the words **"WTB"** and **"WTS"**, but I still see annoying guild-recruiting spam like this:

SomeAnnoyingGuy: Hello! I'm recruiting cool dudes to my Mongolian guild for fun! RandomGuy1: LFM ToC10 need tank, heal, dps, be 6k+, discord RandomGuy2: Hello, I'm a single girl, can you help me in FoS/PoS/HoR? :] RandomGuy3: Wow dudes messages fly so fast that no one will notice that I have a short pinus SomeAnnoyingGuy: Hello! I'm recruiting cool dudes to my Mongolian guild for fun! RandomGuy4: LFM ICC25n need boomkin and holy paladin doing 4/12


I know I'll never want to join a Mongolian guild, so I can write the command:  
`/cf add mongolian guild`  

This will completely filter out that spam. Bingo! Now I can help that girl in FoS/PoS/HoR. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Pros of This Addon:
- **Lightweight**: It‚Äôs not a chat addon, just a filter.
- **Easy to Use**: Activate/deactivate, add/remove words effortlessly.
- **Compatible**: Works with any chat addons.
- **Selective Filtering**: Filters only `/y`, `/s`, and global channels. Your private conversations remain untouched.
- **Exclusions**: Does not block messages from Friends and Guildmates.
- **Shared Filters**: Banned words are shared across all your characters.
- **Message History**: You can view recently blocked messages.

I hope this addon helps you enjoy a cleaner, more readable chat in Icecrown. Cheers! üéâ
