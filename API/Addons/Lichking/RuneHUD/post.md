# RuneHUD

RuneHUD is a simple addon that moves the runes of your DK to make them a HUD (Heads Up Display). The runes are click through which means they don’t intercept mouse clicks. It also has a minimalistic bar showing your current runic power. RuneHUD have OmniCC support and will be hidden when in a vehicle! Access the options menu using the slash command “/rh”, note that there’s a bug in the game which makes it just open the interface menu. To fix it I recommend downloading the addon BlizzBugsSucks.
