# SellGrey

The Sell Grey button appears on the merchant panel and simply sells everything you have in your inventory that is grey. The junk in your bags is not the only thing this add-on does away with. It doesnâ€™t automatically sell all of your items when you open the merchant window. This lets you control win you sell your items. There is also no complex configurations for selling grey items. You click the button and they are gone. You get a nice summary of each sale to the vendor and a grand total of all that wonderful gold you just earned from your junk grey items.
