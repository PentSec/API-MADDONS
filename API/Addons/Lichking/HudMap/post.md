# HudMap

HudMap is an addon that provides a true heads-up tactical display of an encounter, with raid member positions, range data, debuff area-of-effect indicators, and more. Additionally, HudMap ships with totem radius indicators. In general, if you want to do range or player-to-player directional stuff, HudMapâ€™s your huckleberry.
