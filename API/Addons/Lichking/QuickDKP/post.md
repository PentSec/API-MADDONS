# QuickDKP

Quick DKP is an addon for World of Warcraft that aims to handle every aspect of the DKP management of a guild. Its goal is to stay completely in-game, storing points and time amounts in the officer or public notes fields of the guildâ€™s chart, in a clear format readable by everyone without using the mod.
