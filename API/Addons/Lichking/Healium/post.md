# Healium

Healium provides a customizable and intuitive interface optimized to make it easy to heal. Healium allows you to place any spell, item, or macro onto buttons right next to each person’s healthbar. The buttons will cast the spell on the person they are beside of, without the need for you to target the person first.Player healthbars are compact and close to each other which reduces the amount of screen space you have to look over to monitor the party’s health. The spell buttons are very close by, minimizing the space you have to move your mouse, and thus the time required, to cast the spell.Unlike other healing focused addons, Healium does not require you to set up complex key combinations (shift, ctrl, and alt) to cast your spells. In Healium, you just click a healing button next to the person’s health bar. There is no memorization of key combinations required. However, you may use the Clique addon with Healium if you would like to configure mouse and key combinations for some of your heals, to be used along with Healium’s buttons.
