# SkillMonitor

SkillMonitor displays a progress bar that shows how a selected skill is coming along. Let’s say you just decided to level fishing. Well, no more constantly popping open that annoyingly large profession window to check on your progress! Just right-click the progress bar, select Fishing from SkillMonitor’s pop-up menu, and you can see a progress bar that updates as you gain skill.
