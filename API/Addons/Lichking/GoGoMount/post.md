# GoGoMount

One-key mounting solution, useful whether you have just one mount or several. Supports all mounts currently in-game, sensibly chooses/randomizes between what you have. Bind a key and hit it to mount/unmount or shapeshift/deshift, or use ‘/click GoGoButton’ in a macro.GoGoMount is an addon for World of Warcraft that uses some smart logic to determine the best mount for you depending on your skill level (epic or non-epic), type of mount (flying or non-flying), and location (are you in an area that allows flying).GoGoMount will then randomize which mount (if you have several mounts that meet the criteria) it summons so you end up with different types (horses, rams, etc.) and different colors. GoGoMount also has limited support for shape forms used by Druids and Shamans. Instant cast allows for shifting shapes while moving for Druids and Shamans (with points invested in the ability). GoGoMount takes this into consideration when determining the best mount to use.
