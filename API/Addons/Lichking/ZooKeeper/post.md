# ZooKeeper

ZooKeeper is a TBC/WotLK AddOn. It can be used to overcome the ignore list size limitation or simply as another way to mute players, the whole with gorilla sound effects. You can capture/release apes from the target frame, the chat frame and the Ape List accessible on Social (Friends tab). More settings will be added later.
