# Fizzle

This allows you to see, at a glance, the durability and the quality of your gear while the character frame is open.Although in recent years Blizzard added a similar functionality, highlighting the borders of gear in the character frame to show their quality, Fizzleâ€™s borders are much more vivid and easier to see.The addition of the durability text means no more having to highlight gear to see which pieces are damaged and what their durability is at.
