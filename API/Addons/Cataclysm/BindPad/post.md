# BindPad

BindPad is an addon to make KeyBindings for spells, items, and macros. You no longer need actionbar slots just to make Key bindings for your macros etc. BindPad addon provides many icon slots in its frame. You can drag and drop anything into one of these slots, and click the slot to set KeyBindings.
