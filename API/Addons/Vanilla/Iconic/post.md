# Iconic

Iconic integrates into Blizzard’s default Macro UI. There are no slash commands, no setup, and no preferences to mess with. Simply open up your macro window with /macro, write your macro, name it, then when you go to choose your icon use Iconic’s search bar (left of the “Okay” button) to help narrow things down!
