# Scrolling Combat Text

A fairly simple but very configurable mod that adds damage, heals, and events (dodge, parry, windfury, etc…) as scrolling text above you character model, much like what already happens above your target. This makes it so you do not have to watch (or use) your regular combat chat window and gives it a “Final Fantasy” feel.
