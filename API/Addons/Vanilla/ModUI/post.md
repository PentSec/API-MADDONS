# ModUI

A modification for the default UI, adding some quality of life improvements & visual twists with a focus on clean design & light scripting.You can type ‘/modui‘ for a variety of options, or click the ‘M’ button located on the mainbar (replacing keyring, which has been moved over into the bag frame). All elements can be toggled on or off, and any that have been disabled will not load on login.
