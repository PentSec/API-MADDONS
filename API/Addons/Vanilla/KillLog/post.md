# KillLog

Record number of creeps you kill and the amount of experience you receive.Also records deaths.The method of determining if you killed a creep or not is a bit fuzzy.  This is the general style I used.  When a creep dies, if you get experience, it is a kill if you should not get experience (low level / critter / pvp) and you have just done damage to the creep, it is a kill otherwise, it is not a kill. This means that if you kill a creep that you should get experience for but it is tagged by someone else, it will not be counted as a kill.
