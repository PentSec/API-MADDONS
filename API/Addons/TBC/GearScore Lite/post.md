# GearScore Lite

GearScore is an addon that calculated player and item scores in the tooltip. This version has no database, no GUI, no in-game armory, no addon-communications, and minimal system impact. Simply mouse over a player to get a calculation of that player’s Gear or mouse over an item to get a calculation of that item’s GearScore.
