# Align

Very simple and light addon that creates a grid on your screen to aid you in aligning and centering your UI. Align is totally resolution-independent, and will create even grids no matter how you play.I will consider any minor tweaks or updates submitted, but nothing that exceeds the small scope of the addon.Default Toggle: /alignTo change the grid size, type the number after the slash command.Available options:/align 32/align 64/align 128/align 256
