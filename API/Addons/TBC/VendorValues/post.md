# VendorValues

This addon displays in the standard and static tooltips the vendor prices of any items which you have brought to a merchant or which are in the default database. Type “/veva” for configuration options, including the text, color, and visibility of the tooltip’s money line prefix, and whether or not to include a separator line between the price line and the rest of the tooltip.
