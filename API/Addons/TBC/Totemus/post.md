# Totemus

Totemus is mod to help the Shaman manage the totems, buffs, potions, drink/food and messages. It provides a variety of buttons for common spells in an easy-to-use, small, convinient package. The idea was adapted from Venantes and Necrosis LdC to make it usable by shamans.Totemus will provide you a sphere and 10 buttons. The sphere will display information and the outer buttons will provide quick access for several things.
