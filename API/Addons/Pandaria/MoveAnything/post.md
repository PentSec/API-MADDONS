Some other frame modifications are also possible using MA’s Frame Editors (Introduced in 11.b2), including frame strata, frame grouping and more.Type/moveto show the main window or click the button below the game menu. This main window contains a list of Blizzard’s frames (any element not in the list can be added to the Custom Frames category by either /move frameName, /mafe frameName, /hide frameName or one of the move/mafe/hide keybindings).
