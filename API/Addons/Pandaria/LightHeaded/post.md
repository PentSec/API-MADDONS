# LightHeaded

LightHeaded is a very simple addon that displays quest information and comments from http://www.wowhead.com in game, eliminating the need to Alt-Tab when you get stuck on quest. This addon was inspired by qcomments and wowhead_quests, which both serve a similar purpose. Data is only loaded when you first request it, so you can be sure you’re not using more memory than you need to.The following slash commands are valid:/lh attach – Attaches the frame to the quest log/lh detach – Detaches the frame, allows you to resize and move it/lh sound – Toggles the open/close sound/lh page – Toggles showing all comments on one page, or with multiple pages/lh bgalpha <0.0-1.0> – Changes the alpha of the LH window background textures, so you can see the world./lh debug – Enables or disabled debug messages when loading quest databases/lh config – Opens the LightHeaded configuration window/lh autodetails – Toggle automatic opening of the Lightheaded window when clicking a quest in the objective tracker
