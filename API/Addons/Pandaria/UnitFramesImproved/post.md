# UnitFramesImproved

This addon aims to improve upon the standard blizzard unit frames without going beyond the boundaries set by them. Due to this, the addons memory usage is very small as all the hard work to get the unit frames to work is already done by Blizzard, so the addon author just improved upon them.
