# AthComboPoints

Athariel’s Combo Points is a very lightweight addon. It supports rogues & druids for their combo points, as well as paladins and monks with their respective equivalents. This addon has no in-game setup; what you see is what you get – nothing more, nothing less. It features a 5 Combo Point Head-Up Display with an additional row of similar displayed points for Anticipation (rogue talent). It is positioned on the right side of your character. If you wish to move it you will have to fiddle with the Lua code – feel free to do so on your own copy.
