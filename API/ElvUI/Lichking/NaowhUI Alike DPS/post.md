This is an UI created with Elv-UI for WoTLK inspired from NaowhUI from retail. The UI was done on 1920 x 1080 resolution, with Elv-UI scale set to 0.71, and won’t work without SharedMedia addon.

Important:
You need to download ElvUI Enhanced and ElvUI Addon Skins available from the ElvUI download page.
